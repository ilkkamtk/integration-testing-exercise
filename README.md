# REST API integration testing.

### API Documentation (APIDoc)

The API you'll be testing has documentation that describes its endpoints and expected behavior Refer to the APIDoc to know what each endpoint should do and what the expected responses are.

### Testing Scenarios

Your assignment consists of two main parts: testing successful API responses and testing error handling. The test cases for both scenarios are provided in the test folder.

#### 1. Testing Successful Responses

In the test folder, you will find test files with TODO comments for different API endpoints. Your task is to complete these tests by following the provided TODOs. These tests aim to ensure that the API responds correctly when everything goes smoothly.

#### 2. Testing Error Handling

Similarly, in the test folder, you will find test files with TODO comments for error scenarios. Your goal is to complete these tests to validate that the API handles errors appropriately. The error tests cover various situations, including 404 errors, validation errors, and more.
